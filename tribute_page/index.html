          Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South
          African anti-apartheid activist and politician who served as the first
          president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's
          first black head of state and the first elected in a fully
          representative democratic election. His presidency marked the end of
          decades of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination in
          South Africa.

          Born in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's
          Cape Province, Mandela studied law at the University of Fort Hare and
          the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in
          Johannesburg. He became involved in anti-colonial and African
          nationalist politics, joining the African National Congress (ANC) in
          1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National
          Party's white-only government established apartheid—a system of racial
          segregation that privileged whites—Mandela and the ANC committed
          themselves to its overthrow. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious
          activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason
          Trial.

          Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African
          Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent
          protest, in association with the SACP, he co-founded the militant
          Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the
          apartheid government. In 1962, he was arrested for conspiring to
          overthrow the state and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Rivonia
          Trial. Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island,
          Pollsmoor Prison, and Victor Verster Prison.

          Amid growing domestic and international pressure and fears of racial
          civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and
          de Klerk negotiated an end to apartheid and organized the 1994
          multiracial general election, in which Mandela led the ANC to victory
          and became president. Leading a broad coalition government that
          promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasized reconciliation
          between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and
          Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. He
          declined a second presidential term and focused on combating poverty
          and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.

          Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Critics on
          the right denounced him as a communist terrorist, while those on the
          radical left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with
          apartheid's supporters. Despite these criticisms, he gained
          international acclaim for his activism, receiving more than 250
          honors—including the Nobel Peace Prize—and becoming a global icon of
          social justice. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where
          he is often referred to by his Xhosa clan name, Madiba, and described
          as the "Father of the Nation".
